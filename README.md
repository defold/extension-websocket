[![Build Status](https://github.com/defold/extension-websocket/workflows/Build%20with%20bob/badge.svg)](https://github.com/defold/extension-websocket/actions)

## Installation
To use this library in your Defold project, add the following URL to your `game.project` dependencies:

https://github.com/defold/extension-websocket/archive/master.zip

We recommend using a link to a zip file of a [specific release](https://github.com/defold/extension-websocket/releases).

## API reference

https://defold.com/extension-websocket/

https://defold.com/extension-websocket/websocket_api/

## Additional server API reference

This extension also includes a simple websocket server (ws://). Websocket server is not supported in HTML5 builds. Secure (wss://) websocket server is not supported.

```
websocket.listen(port, max_connections, connection_timeout, callback)
```
- `port`, number. Port to listen on.
- `max_connections`, number. Maximum allowed number of connections.
- `connection_timeout`, number. Time in seconds to wait for a connnection to be established.
- `callback`, function. Callback that receives connection events. The same as for the `connect` function.

Starts a websocket server on the specified port.

```
websocket.stop_listening()
```
Stops the websocket server.

There are additional fields inside the `data` table in the callback.
- `request_method`, string. Request method, e.g. `"GET"`. In case of running as a server.
- `request_resource`, string. Request resource, e.g. `"/"`. In case of running as a server.
- `ip_address`, string. IP address of the connection.
- `port`, number. Port of the connection.

## Debugging

In order to make it easier to debug this extension, we provide a `game.project` setting `websocket.debug` (edit `game.project` as text and add):

```
[websocket]
debug = level
```

Set it to:

* `0` to disable debugging (i.e. no debug output).
* `1` to display state changes.
* `2` to display the messages sent and received.

## External resources

To verify that your websocket server works, you can test it with some tools.

* [websocat](https://github.com/vi/websocat)

Or, you can test your server on this web page:

* https://www.websocket.org/echo.html

To monitor all the packets sent to/from the client/server, you can use e.g.

* [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org)

For command line debugging, there's

* tcpdump: `sudo tcpdump -X -s0 -ilo0 port 8080 ` (example for local ws:// connection)

* tcpdump: `sudo tcpdump -X -s0 host echo.websocket.org` (Monitors packets to/from echo.websocket.org)
